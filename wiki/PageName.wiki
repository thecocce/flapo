#summary Ideas.

= Introduction =

Ideas from Zach to improve the game.

= Details =

*Level designs*
 * Space _nice, with decreased slowdown values, and little gravity, so you can control the ball in "air"_
 * Roman _maybe_
 * Egyptians _must have, all the sand, pyramids, lots of yellow color and hieroglyphs_
 * Japanese/Chinese _?_
 * Mountains _definitely_
 * Desert _?_
 * Forest _or jungle_
 * Circus _I don't know_
 * Etc. _desktop?_

*Ball*
 * Beach Ball
 * Bowling Ball
 * Tennis Ball
 * Basket Ball
 * Baseball
 * Metal Ball
 * Glass Ball
 * The Pixar Ball
 * Etc.
_or we can variate the ball theme along level designs, rock for the Egyptian pyramid, cocus for the oasis, glass ball for desktop theme, meteor for space?_

*Changes*
 * The word "WIN" or "LOSE" in green dots covering the screen _I'm thinking about totally change WIN and LOSE, as it's looking very unprofessional._
 * Better Ball physics _I changed the friction, so the ball rolling little more after   released the keys_
 * Better cursor _? I will to use W A S D, but I have no other idea about improving "cursor"_
 * When you lose or win you can just press the "Enter/Return" key to continue or restart _You can continue with SPACE, but I will add Enter and maybe some text like 'press space/enter'_
 * The Music _Currently I'm experimenting with MOD musics, but with litle luck, as I can't find any really good music which fit my game_
 * The Font _Using Times new roman, which is very basic. What kind would be nice?_

New Ideas:
 * Slopes _hard to support. However, with slopes, obstacles, it will be too similar to Gyroscope and it's clones._
 * Obstacles:
 * *    Enemies _great idea, lot's of code, maybe next version_
 * *   Color coded blocks (your ball needs to be a certain color to pass) _already done_
 * Time Limit/Clock _Nice idea, and some score system will be fine, and Kongregate achievments_
 * A Menu _would be nice_
 * Level Selection _definitely. There are 3-4 world (whith one theme, like forest, Egyptian, etc. each with 10-20 level, and you can freely play the first 1-3 level from each theme, then if you completed then you can play further levels or replay old levels_
